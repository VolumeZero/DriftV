# DriftV
Drift base for FiveM

Made by Rubylium
Fork by Gavin1593/VolumeZero

Changes made:
Global drift point scoreboard!
Sell Vehicles for their orignal price!
Better controller support in menus!
Better and easier to track ui!
Custom pay exports for use in esx scripts! (My server has a full casino using the money system in driftv for example) 
Less chat spam from Drift Trials!



This gamemode has been designed to work with OneSync infinity. It will work without it, but performance can be worse.
