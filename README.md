# DriftV
Drift base for FiveM
 Made by Rubylium
 
 Fork by Gavin1593/VolumeZero

Changes made:

 Global drift points on scoreboard.
 Sell Vehicles for their orignal price.
 Better controller support in menus.
 Better and easier to track ui.
 Custom pay exports for use in esx scripts.
 Less chat spam from Drift Trials.
 Full vehicle customization in garage. (Added tint, neon, xenon, and more missing cosmetic items.) 

ALL of these changes are tested are on my custom server with the "lobby" completely removed. So some things like controller support might not work correctly or at all within the lobby!!!


This gamemode has been designed to work with OneSync infinity. It will work without it, but performance can be worse.
